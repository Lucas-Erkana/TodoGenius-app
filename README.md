## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

> Add at least 2 questions new developers would ask when they decide to use your project.

- **How can I deploy the TaskGenius app to a web server and make it accessible to others?**

  - To deploy the TaskGenius app, you have several options. One common approach is to use a hosting service like Heroku, AWS, or Azure. These services provide easy-to-use deployment options for web applications like TaskGenius. Typically, you'll need to push your project to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub) and then configure the hosting service to deploy the app automatically whenever you push changes. Each hosting service has its own documentation and guides on how to set up the deployment for web applications.

- **How can I modify the TaskGenius app to fit my specific needs?**

  - Modifying the TaskGenius app involves modifying the existing code and adding your own features. Here are some steps you can take to customize the app:

    - Change Content: Update the text in the components to fit your specific needs. For example, you can update the task categories or add new ones.

    - Add Features: If you want to add new features to the app, you can create a new component or modify an existing one. For example, you can add a feature to set reminders for tasks or to share tasks with other users.

    - Styling: To change the appearance, you can modify the CSS styles in the index.css file or create a separate CSS file and import it into the components where you need custom styling. You can update colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual elements to match your preferences.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
